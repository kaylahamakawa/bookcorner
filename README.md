# Welcome to my book corner

Hello!  My name is Kayla Hamakawa, and welcome to _BookCorner_, which is my literary blog to talk about and review the books I have read.  

I have recently rekindled my love for reading during quarantine, and I have read 45/50 books so far this year!  So come along with me on my reading journey :)

**Lord of the Flies**

The basic premise of this story is how a group of boys who have landed on a deserted island from a plane crash learn to survive on the island.  This is such a fun book to analyze, since it is an allegorical story that is rich in symbols, and I have been heavily annotating it.  (I will post a spoiler filled review later.)

**The Picture of Dorian Gray**

I have just started this book, so I'm only a few pages in, but I'm so excited to get into it!  So far, it's intriguing and is definitely one of the easier classics to read.
